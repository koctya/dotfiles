# Unix notes

### htop
htop is what top looks like after she puts on her dancing shoes on a Friday night
It's such an improvement over plain ole' top — with no known downsides — that I have an alias in my shell:

     if [[ -x `which htop` ]]; then alias top="htop"; fi

To install htop from repos:

   # Debian
   $ aptitude install htop
   # Arch
   $ pacman -S htop
   # OS X
   brew install htop-osx

### ack

ack is a text search tool akin to grep, but with some pretty distinct advantages:

- fast — it only searches what makes sense to search
- defaults to recursive searches
- defaults to colored output
- defaults to show line numbers of matched strings
- takes fewer keystrokes
- uses Perl's powerful regular expressions

Needless to say, it's better than grep.

To install ack from repos:

   # Debian
   $ aptitude install ack-grep
   $ ln -s /usr/bin/ack-grep /usr/bin/ack
   # Arch
   $ pacman -S ack
   # OS X
   $ brew install ack

### tree

tree is a great way to wrap your head around a directory structure instead of `cd`ing and `ls`ing all over the place.

The output can be a bit overwhelming for directories with many files and subdirectories, but it can be easily piped to `less` so you can page and navigate it.

To install tree from repos:

   # Debian
   $ aptitude install tree
   # Arch
   $ pacman -S tree
   # OS X
   $ brew install tree

### GEdit
Syntax Highlighting

A very useful feature of gedit is the ability to color programming code. Using syntax highlighting makes simple errors easier to recognize. gedit uses the GtkSourceView package for syntax highlighting. The .lang file for a specific programing language is located in the `/usr/share/gtksourceview-2.0/language-specs/` folder. These files may be edited or additional files created to further define the highlighting definitions.
