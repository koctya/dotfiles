> "I greatly appreciate everything you said. It’s very true. Everybody who learns JavaScript for the first time is seduced by it, not realizing how truly awful the language is and not understanding how much trouble they’ll get into further down the road. JavaScript fans love to point at Node, claiming that it’s easy to use and very flexible and very fast for concurrent processing. However, [there are serious limitations in Node](https://medium.com/javascript-non-grata/the-fall-of-the-house-of-node-43697fd56a6) and asking people to use JavaScript is a major turn-off for many."
"NPM is another joke. Yes, there are countless thousands of NPM packages but most of them are junk! NPM is a huge, disorganized morass."
"Node fans say that its greatest advantage is letting you use one language throughout the entire stack, from front to back end. Really? That’s a huge advantage? Veteran IT pros have been polyglot for ages, and using multiple languages for software projects has never — ever! — been an issue."
